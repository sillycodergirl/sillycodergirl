## üíº Projects
### FUNK Engine
 - Currently a WIP, FUNK Engine is a full built-from-scratch engine made in HaxeFlixel. 
 - Planned to have many new features like:
 -- Based off .fnfc, one file that holds the entire song data for a song called .funk
 -- A readable codebase for new programmers (almost everything is documented)
 -- A cleaner experience for the programmers AND the players.
 (more coming soon)
